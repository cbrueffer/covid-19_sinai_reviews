Reduction of lymphocyte at early stage elevates severity and death risk
of COVID-19 patients: a hospital-based case-cohort study

**Keywords:** COVID-19, lymphocyte, severity, organ injuries.

**Main findings:** The aim of this study was to assess an association
between reduced blood lymphocyte counts at hospital admission and
prognosis of COVID-19 patients (n=192). The authors found:

-   Patients with lymphopenia are more likely to progress to severe
    disease or succumb to COVID-19 (32.1% of COVID-19 patients with
    lymphocyte reduction died).

-   Reduction of lymphocytes mainly affects the elderly (&gt; 70 years
    old).

-   Lymphocyte reduction is more prevalent in COVID-19 patients with
    cardiac disease and pulmonary disease, patients with increase in the
    chest CT score (key marker of lung injury) and a decrease in several
    respiratory function markers (PaCO2, SpO2, oxygenation index).

**Limitations of the study:** Reduced blood lymphocyte counts with aging
have been known
([*https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.08.20031229v2*](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.08.20031229v2))

Therefore, it is not unexpected that a larger fraction of COV ID-19
patients above 70 years old have lower lymphocytes counts. Since age has
been reported to be a major factor that determines outcome for COVID-19,
lymphocyte counts and prognosis should have been adjusted by age.
Multivariate analysis to identify independent risk factors is lacking.

**Relevance:** Previous studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection
leads to a decrease of the T cell count. This study confirms these
results and shows that lymphocyte reduction mainly affects the elderly.
Lymphopenia was associated with disease severity as well as worse
prognosis. Future studies need to address if lymphopenia is a negative
predictive factor independent from age.
