**Main Findings**

The immunity of the mucosa between the mother and the newborn against
COVID-19 was tested. The secretory antibody -IgA of breastfeeding milk,
shown immune response to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2
Spike protein.

[]{#limitations .anchor}**Limitations**

Further studies are needed to understand the types of vaccines and
routes of administrations in terms of protective antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 in human milk.

**Significance**

Immune-modulating factors in breast milk may exert a significant impact
on the infantâ€™s developing immune system preventing or mitigating
SARS-Cov-2 infection.
